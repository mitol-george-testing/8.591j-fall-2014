Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _8.591J Systems Biology_ as it was taught by Jeff Gore, Latham Family Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics in Fall 2014.

This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Understand how cells respond to the environment and process information in order to divide.
*   Explore how interactions between genes influence the decision-making of cells.
*   Examine how interactions between individuals shape how the population behaves in response to environmental pressures.

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

*   [_Introductory Biology 7.012_](/courses/7-012-introduction-to-biology-fall-2004/)  
    (Biology GIR ![](/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png))
*   [_Differential Equations 18.03_](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/)
*   [_Probability 18.05_](/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/)

In addition, each weekly problem had a computational problem, so prior experience with a computational package such as MATLAB®, Mathematica®, or Python was expected. The “officially supported” package was be Python (sample code, etc), but students were able to do problems in any language.

### Requirements Satisfied

GIR Science Core, Biology

### Offered

Every fall semester

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class/Lecture
----------------

*   Met 2 times per week for 90 minute sessions; 24 sessions total, mandatory attendance.
*   In-class activities included multiple-choice concept questions ![](/images/educator/icon-question-conq.png) and collaborative learning.

Out of Class
------------

*   Students were required to submit answers to the pre-class reading questions online, prior to each lecture.
*   Students completed weekly problem sets for the course.
