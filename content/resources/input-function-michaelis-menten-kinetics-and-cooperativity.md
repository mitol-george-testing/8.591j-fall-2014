**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Jeff Gore discusses the kinetics of gene expression. The lecture begins with simple input-output relationships and chemical/enzyme kinetics. He then moves on to response time for stable proteins. He finishes with ultrasensitivity: cooperative binding or multimer molecular titration.

**Instructor:** Prof. Jeff Gore
